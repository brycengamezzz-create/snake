# Main Sheet

Simple launcher that gives quick access to common sites (Netflix, Poki, CrazyGames, Google, Firefox).

Quick start (local):

1. Open a terminal in the project folder:

```bash
cd /workspaces/snake
```

2. Start a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open this URL in your browser:

http://localhost:8000

How to use:
- Click a card to navigate to the site (opens in the same tab).
- Use the search box to search Google or enter a URL and press Enter.
- Press Alt+1..Alt+5 to open quick sites (see the footer in the app).
- Click Settings in the app to edit and save each card's destination URL (stored in your browser via `localStorage`).

Notes and policies:
- I cannot assist with hiding, obfuscating, or making links "indetectible" or otherwise bypassing network or device filters. The app intentionally keeps links visible and editable for transparency and accessibility.

Want this published online? I can help push and enable GitHub Pages or deploy to another host if you want.
